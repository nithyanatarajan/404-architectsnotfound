### Context
In a distributed microservices environment, observability is critical to monitor system health, debug production issues, and trace request flows. We need a complete, open-source-based observability stack that supports metrics, logs, and tracing using open standards.

---

### Alternatives
- Proprietary platforms (e.g., Datadog, New Relic)
- Cloud-native tools (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, GCP Operations Suite)
- OSS stack (OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Jaeger)

---

### PrOACT
- **Problem:** Limited visibility into distributed services makes incident response and monitoring difficult
- **Objectives:** Unified, real-time, end-to-end observability across services
- **Alternatives:** Cloud-native tooling, APM vendors, Open-source stack
- **Consequences:** OSS stack requires operational expertise to manage and scale
- **Tradeoffs:** Vendor independence and flexibility vs. setup and maintenance effort

---

### Decision
Use the following tools:
- **OpenTelemetry** for vendor-neutral instrumentation
- **Prometheus** for metrics collection and alerting
- **Grafana** for visualization and dashboarding
- **Loki** for log aggregation
- **Jaeger** for distributed tracing

This stack supports full observability across services using open standards and integrates well with Kubernetes.

### Tradeoffs - Mitigations
- **Operational Overhead** → Use Helm charts and pre-configured dashboards
- **Scalability Concerns** → Design storage and retention strategies, use horizontal scaling
- **Onboarding Curve** → Document conventions, provide reusable templates
