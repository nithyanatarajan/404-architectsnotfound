### Context
To enable cloud-native scalability, isolation, and reliability, we require a modern infrastructure stack that supports container orchestration, declarative provisioning, and repeatable deployments. Kubernetes, Helm, and Terraform together offer a robust foundation.

---

### Alternatives
- Docker Swarm + shell scripts
- ECS/Fargate with CloudFormation
- Kubernetes with Helm and Terraform

---

### PrOACT
- **Problem:** Need consistent, scalable deployment and management of containerized workloads
- **Objectives:** Automate deployments, ensure reproducibility, enable portability across clouds
- **Alternatives:** Swarm, ECS, Kubernetes
- **Consequences:** Kubernetes has a steep learning curve and operational cost
- **Tradeoffs:** Setup complexity vs. robust orchestration, scaling, and control

---

### Decision
Adopt **Kubernetes** for workload orchestration, **Helm** for managing application manifests and templating, and **Terraform** for declarative infrastructure-as-code (IaC) provisioning.

---

### Tradeoffs - Mitigations
- **Initial setup complexity** → Use opinionated Helm charts and Terraform modules
- **Learning curve** → Team enablement via internal tooling and documentation
