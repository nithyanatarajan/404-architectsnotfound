### Context
Security is a core requirement in managing secrets, credentials, and ensuring image-level vulnerability scanning in CI/CD pipelines. We need tools that support automation, integration, and compliance.

### Alternatives
- Kubernetes Secrets + Docker Bench
- Vault + Trivy
- AWS Secrets Manager + AWS Inspector

### PrOACT
- **Problem:** Securely managing secrets and detecting container image vulnerabilities early
- **Objectives:** Automate secret rotation, scan images for known vulnerabilities
- **Alternatives:** K8s native secrets, Vault, AWS-native tools
- **Consequences:** Added configuration and policy enforcement overhead
- **Tradeoffs:** Operational setup vs. long-term security posture

### Decision
Use **Vault** for secure secret storage and dynamic credential management and **Trivy** for vulnerability scanning during Docker image builds and CI/CD pipelines.

### Tradeoffs - Mitigations
- **Complex Configuration**: Standardize Vault usage via Helm charts and Terraform
- **False Positives in Scans**: Configure Trivy thresholds and custom rules
