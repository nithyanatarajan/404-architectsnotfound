1. C4 Diagrams

Start with:

    Context Diagram – Show InterviewLogger, MindComputeScheduler, LeavePlanner, MyMindComputeProfile, Chatbot, etc.
    Container Diagram – Define backend services (e.g., scheduler, matcher, notifier, dashboard, chatbot interface).
    Component Diagram – Zoom into chatbot or scheduler logic for a deeper breakdown.

2. Architectural Characteristics

Explicitly state and justify design choices for:

    Scalability (e.g., stateless microservices, auto-scaling)
    Availability (retry logic, fallback flows, queues)
    Observability (structured logging, distributed tracing, alerting)
    Security (OAuth for recruiter logins? Secrets management?)

3. AI & Agentic Tooling

Suggestions:

    Using LLMs for NLP parsing in chatbot.
    Suggesting agent-based architecture for interviewer matchmaking or escalation handling.

4. Operational Aspects

Missing lifecycles:

    CI/CD (e.g., GitHub Actions, ArgoCD?)
    Testing (unit, integration, E2E)
    Monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana? GCP-native tools?)
    Logging (ELK/Stackdriver?)

5. ADRs

Examples:

    Use MindComputeScheduler vs replace it.
    Why use Messenger
    Why microservices
    API-first approach vs event-driven (or hybrid).
    Justify AI usage (e.g., to shortlist interviewers).
