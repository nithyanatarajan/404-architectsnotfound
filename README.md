## Problem Statement

> Interview Scheduling is Broken â€” Letâ€™s Fix It with Automation

Recruiters at MindCompute are spending far too much time manually coordinating interviewsâ€”matching skills, checking
availability, avoiding scheduling conflicts, and handling declines. The current process involves multiple systems
(InterviewLogger, MindComputeScheduler, MyMindComputeProfile, LeavePlanner) but no centralized intelligence or automation. The result? Missed
interviews, double bookings, rescheduling chaos, frustrated interviewers and candidates.

Our goal is to streamline and automate the **interviewer discovery**, **scheduling**, **rescheduling**, and
**notification flow** with a smart, integrated system and chatbot interfaceâ€”reducing manual effort and accelerating
the hiring process.
