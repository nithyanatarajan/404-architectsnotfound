# RecruitX Next ‚Äì Interview Scheduling Platform | Architectural Kata 2025

> The comeback of a loved tool ‚Äî redesigned, reimagined.

Welcome to our architectural submission for **ArchKata 25**. RecruitX Next is a resilient, extensible, and observable
interview scheduling platform that automates recruiter workflows and provides fallback mechanisms for real-world edge
cases.

---

## üìå Problem Statement

Recruiters at MindCompute are spending far too much time manually coordinating interviews‚Äîmatching skills, checking
availability, avoiding scheduling conflicts, and handling declines. The current process involves multiple systems
(InterviewLogger, MindComputeScheduler, MyMindComputeProfile, LeavePlanner) but no centralized intelligence or automation. The result? Missed
interviews, double bookings, rescheduling chaos, frustrated interviewers and candidates.

Our goal is to streamline and automate the **interviewer discovery**, **scheduling**, **rescheduling**, and
**notification flow** with a smart, integrated system and chatbot interface ‚Äî reducing manual effort and accelerating
the hiring process.

## üß† How It All Works (Narrative)

> For detailed journey, refer [`UserJourneys.md`](./docs/UserJourneys.md).

RecruitX Next follows a streamlined, resilient architecture for interview scheduling.

- A recruiter initiates scheduling via the dashboard or chatbot.
- The system fetches all relevant data (interviewer availability, preferences, PTO, load) from **Redis**, which acts as
  the single source of information for the system.
- This data is periodically synced via a background job (`harvest-sync`) from external systems like Calendar,
  MindComputeScheduler, and LeavePlanner.
- The **slot-seeker** computes valid time slots, and the **scheduler** selects the best-fit interviewer using scoring
  rules.
- Candidates receive invite links and can confirm slots ‚Äî triggering event updates and notifications.
- Alerts and updates are pushed via **Messenger Notifier** and emails.
- **All reads are cache-first**; no live API calls are made during interactive flows.
- **Kafka handles event-driven workflows**, with DLQs ensuring message reliability and traceability.
- If anything fails (e.g., sync job, webhook), alerts are raised and fallback mechanisms ensure continuity.
- AI/LLM components enhance both chatbot responses and analytics reporting ‚Äî without being hardwired to a specific
  provider.

The architecture is designed to be:

- Observable by default
- Resilient to failures
- Secure by design
- Modular and pluggable
- Friendly for both humans and automation

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

- **MindComputeScheduler API Assumed**: API availability is assumed for fetching interviewer preferences; no official integration
  verified.
- **No Real-Time External Queries**: System is cache-first by design; real-time sync is deferred to background jobs,
  which may lead to temporary staleness.
- **LLM Provider Flexibility, but Untested**: While the AI layer is pluggable, company-specific
  model performance hasn‚Äôt been benchmarked.
- **Manual Feedback Still Required**: Feedback collection remains a manual step; nudges are sent, but the loop is not
  fully automated.
- **Fallback UI is Passive**: Manual override flows exist but require user action; no auto-escalation or smart retry.
- **Multi-Tenancy Out of Scope**: System is designed for single-tenant operation (MindCompute only).
